you need gcc4 to compile it. That means, if you are using a hybrid perhaps you need to run the command "segcc gcc4" first.
You can compile now the program by writing "jam" in the terminal from inside the source-directory.

You need at least r1ac3 rc   to be able to run the application without major problems.

The source code is very dirty. It needs to be cleaned and restructured and some things reimplemented. I did most of the work late at night and under time pressure I decided to implement the solution that was the fastest to implement. I hope this summer i will have some time to clean it
